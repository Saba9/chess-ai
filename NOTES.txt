- Fixed memory issues (I think). Mostly used valgrind to identify issues. Solved with smart_pointers (C++11). Remember copies of GameState are shallow.
- Need to implement deep copy later. (After weird index stuff is fixed).
- For some reason RecalculateMoves is called with index of -88. Probably some weird memory crap. IDK. gdb might help.
