- Fixed issue mentioned one June 12th (2nd bullet) by modifying the ChessState object instead of doing a shallow copy.

- DeepCopy seems to be working. For some reason it looks like the reason why setting the tracker to nullptr would'nt set the possible_moves tracker to nullptr is because the possible_moves nullptr was pointing to another shared pointer. Not sure why. Should figure this out. Using deep copy inside of GetNewState fixes this.
- Oh... The issue is (I believe) that when we shallow copy a ChessState, copies of the shared_pointers in trackers are made that aren't linked to the pointers in the copied possible_moves and blocked_moves. So, we need to nullify the shared_pointer stored in the trackers array of the ChessState we copied from in order to effect the copied possible_moves and blocked_moves.

- Fixed issue with the call to RecalculateMoves w/ a value of -88. Was pushing address of a pointer to a shared pointer which was promptly destroyed after exiting the function's scope. Now pushing address of pointer to tracker stored in trackers[] instead.

- Fixed memory issues (I think). Mostly used valgrind to identify issues. Solved with smart_pointers (C++11). Remember copies of GameState are shallow.
- Need to implement deep copy later. (After weird index stuff is fixed).
- For some reason RecalculateMoves is called with index of -88. Probably some weird memory crap. IDK. gdb might help.
- Should probably change ownership implementation do differentiate between squares with no pieces and those with.
