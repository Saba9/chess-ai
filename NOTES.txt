- Fixed issue with the call to RecalculateMoves w/ a value of -88. Was pushing address of a pointer to a shared pointer which was promptly destroyed after exiting the function's scope. Now pushing address of pointer to tracker stored in trackers[] instead.

- Fixed memory issues (I think). Mostly used valgrind to identify issues. Solved with smart_pointers (C++11). Remember copies of GameState are shallow.
- Need to implement deep copy later. (After weird index stuff is fixed).
- For some reason RecalculateMoves is called with index of -88. Probably some weird memory crap. IDK. gdb might help.
- Should probably change ownership implementation do differentiate between squares with no pieces and those with.
